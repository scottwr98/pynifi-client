# TODOs

1. Add integration tests using NiFi-local/NiFi-docker
2. Refactor so that multiple versions of the NiFi DTOs and Entities can be supported by one client library.
3. MVP/Least effort for the above would be to use releases/branches with installs managed by pip.
4. Investigate whether the DTOs/Entities and REST API are backwards compatible for the primary versions of NiFi
